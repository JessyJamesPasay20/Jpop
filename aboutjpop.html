                    <h1>About</h1>   
                    <p>
                        The word J-pop was first used not long after the Japanese war ended, at that time something similar was named "Kayoukyoku", Which means popular songs. 
                        A word that is also used is Hougaku, which means Japanese music, In Japan it represents all jpop music. And lastly, Junghougaku represents all traditional Japenese music. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The one who came up with the word J-pop was a Japanese radio station named J-WAVE in order to advertise their music, which was usually "urban style" (stylish).
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        So for the first time Jpop was even a thing, it was actually branded as a stylish form of music. After J-WAVE's idea was public, companies started using Jpop to brand their own music. 
                        And that is how the ball began to roll.

                    <h2>Idols</h2>
                        <p> 
                            In the Jpop world, there is a widely popular subgenre within Jpop called Idols. 
                            Idols are types of entertainers which make use of 'cuteness' and a happy personality to sell their songs.
                            While also focusing on mastering their skills in acting, dancing and modeling. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Their usual objective is offering fans a way to "escape" reality with their voice and performance.
                            That is why idols are also extremely popular in the online world, use Hololive for example.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the term "Idol" sounds very positive. Lives of these entertainers are often dictated by their talent
                            agency, who strictly manage their lives so they remain in "perfect" condition. This would often be called the "dark side" of 
                            Idolism and usually ignored by the majority of their fanbase.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Idols are most popular in Japan and primarily inspired by anime idols. Which you can see an 
                            example of on the "Helpful video's" row.
